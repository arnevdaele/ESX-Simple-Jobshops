# ESX Simple Jobshops
 A simple job permission shop system for ESX with easy configuration.
 
 ### Caution
 This script is built for the ESX Weight system and will not work on the limit system, you'll need to rewrite the server-side code for yourself.
 
 ### Usage
 Shops can be added through the config.lua file and is pretty self explanatory.
